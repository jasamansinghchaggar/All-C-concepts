## Stage 1: Fundamentals (1-2 weeks)

### Topics:
- Basic syntax and structure of C.
- Data types, variables, and operators.
- Control structures (`if`, `else`, loops).
- Functions and parameter passing.

### Practice:
- Basic arithmetic programs.
- Implement conditional logic programs (e.g., prime numbers, sum of digits).
<!--
---

## Stage 2: Arrays, Strings, and Structures (3-4 weeks)

### Topics:
- Single and multidimensional arrays.
- String manipulation using character arrays.
- Structures and user-defined data types.
- Unions and enums.

### Practice:
- Implement sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion).
- Build a student record system using structures.

---

## Stage 3: Pointers and Dynamic Memory (4-5 weeks)

### Topics:
- Pointer basics and pointer arithmetic.
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`).
- Function pointers and arrays as pointers.
- Pointers to structures.

### Practice:
- Build a dynamic array.
- Implement a linked list (singly, doubly, and circular).

---

## Stage 4: File Handling and I/O (3-4 weeks)

### Topics:
- File I/O functions (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, etc.).
- Working with binary files.
- Command-line arguments.

### Practice:
- Build a simple text editor.
- Create a system to store records in binary files.

---

## Stage 5: Data Structures and Algorithms (6-8 weeks)

### Topics:
- Linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Trees and tree traversal algorithms.
- Graphs (BFS, DFS).
- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort) and searching algorithms.

### Practice:
- Implement a binary search tree (BST) with basic operations.
- Create a graph with traversal algorithms.

---

## Stage 6: Advanced C Features (5-6 weeks)

### Topics:
- Bitwise operations.
- Preprocessors and macros.
- Custom memory management.
- Function pointers for callbacks.

### Practice:
- Write a program that manipulates individual bits.
- Create a memory manager that simulates `malloc` and `free`.

---

## Stage 7: Multithreading and Concurrency (4-5 weeks)

### Topics:
- Processes and threads.
- Thread synchronization (mutexes, semaphores).
- Interprocess communication (pipes, shared memory).

### Practice:
- Implement a producer-consumer problem using threads.
- Create a multithreaded web server.

---

## Stage 8: System Programming and Real-World Applications (6-8 weeks)

### Topics:
- System calls for file handling, process control.
- Socket programming (TCP/UDP).
- Debugging and optimization techniques.

### Practice:
- Build a simple HTTP server.
- Create a Unix-like shell with basic commands.
